1
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:04,200
(Michael claps)

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:09,880
And have another
sip... 

3
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:25,780
(Sounds: Shutters)

4
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:43,400
(Sounds: Monitor)

5
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,240
So!

6
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,080
First I insert the
punched tape.

7
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:58,980
(Sounds: Paper tape reader)

8
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,520
Reading in the program can
now begin...

9
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:04,200
Hello Dietmar!

10
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,720
Hello Michael, greetings!

11
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:08,160
How did you come up with the idea of ​​doing
a diploma thesis together?

12
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:11,280
Many did that in our course
back then.

13
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,120
This has a simple effect: You are
initially only

14
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,500
looking for only one thesis that you
can do with two people.

15
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,200
You can also cover a larger
scope:

16
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:21,180
So you can create a more comprehensive
diploma theses!

17
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:23,860
Many diploma theses consisted of a practical
and a theoretical part...

18
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:25,260
You can split it
up better!

19
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:28,220
It was like that with us, to some
extent...

20
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,220
That was the idea!

21
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:31,340
We also talked to older
students

22
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:34,260
who had already done their diploma theses...
Our Lab Engineers, too!

23
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,500
That wasn't unusual, several people
did that.

24
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,320
And also the topic of motivation, if you
have a hanger, for two...

25
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,760
The other one can give a quick "kick in the ass",
spoken in plain language!

26
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,580
When you're once
again stuck!

27
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:47,140
Or you wrote something
in bad German...

28
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,680
Or somehow you got on the wrong track,
the second one can help you!

29
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,720
We noticed that already in the
learning phase

30
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,180
that it is simply better to work in
a team than alone!

31
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:58,740
And then Professor Harth approached us
and had the idea:

32
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:00,220
A great work for two!

33
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:04,400
And he knew our background that we both...
didn't just come...

34
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,580
from high school and internships,

35
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:07,620
but really did an apprenticeship.

36
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,660
So Uschi's apprenticeship was three years,
or three and a half...

37
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:10,740
She did something with optics?

38
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:12,860
Optician, she properly learned to
be an optician.

39
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,560
And the professor knew that...
And I think that was

40
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,300
also the background why we
were approached:

41
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:20,660
Because of course he needed someone, or both,
with a practical background.

42
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:22,220
Because he knew the work would consist
of a lot...

43
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:25,940
assembly- and grinding- and
plugging-work.

44
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:28,080
He had a fellow student
friend,

45
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,840
who was at GMD in the
meantime:

46
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,560
Dr. Schäfer!

47
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,760
GMD, that is the "Gesellschaft für Mathematik und
Datenverarbeitung"!

48
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,340
It no longer exists in that form, it
has been renamed.

49
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:43,340
And it has been called like that, it was near
Cologne, Sankt Augustin near Bonn.

50
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:46,340
And he got us an appointment straight
away, over the phone.

51
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:48,180
And then we went there in the
afternoon...

52
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:51,660
And then he introduced us to the actual
work, how this will play out.

53
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,340
And then it was clear to us: Okay, the whole thing
won't take place in Cologne!

54
00:02:55,980 --> 00:03:00,960
It takes at least half a year, or maybe a
similar time period.

55
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:02,440
It wouldn't be short
thing anymore!

56
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,980
And they also gave us
a candy with us:

57
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:06,860
We get a certain basic
salary!

58
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,880
And the apartment is provided by the
city of Hünfeld.

59
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:12,440
And then on that day we
went to...

60
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:15,620
Zuse, he made appointments with Zuse in Hünfeld.

61
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:17,400
Then we once more also
drove there.

62
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,580
And only after that we
should decide.

63
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:22,120
And when we were there and
then have met Zuse...

64
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,220
We then drove away
to Cologne...

65
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:25,020
On the way back we already
thought about it:

66
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,720
It excites us! It makes sense!
Let's try it! We make it!

67
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,100
And then we have signed and
started the work!

68
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:32,640
Well, you weren't a computer scientist now...
Well, if I...

69
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,720
If I had had this chance as a computer
scientist, I wouldn't have...

70
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,180
I wouldn't have hesitated for a second, I would
have done it immediately!

71
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:40,480
But if you're not from
that field,

72
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,180
then maybe you're not
yet quite so...

73
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:45,320
Exactly! That was also my concern that I wouldn't
understand the whole topic.

74
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,780
And that's how it was for the first few weeks!
We have it...

75
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:49,280
Well, it was all Greek
to me!

76
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,440
I didn't understand the machine
how this works!

77
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,360
The Binary System was completely unknown to
me until then.

78
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,200
I knew that it consists of
zero and one...

79
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:01,620
But I only learned how to digitally add, subtract and 
multiply in my diploma thesis.

80
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,620
So there were still a few hurdles that we
had to overcome.

81
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:05,600
You have to say that
very clearly!

82
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,180
So definitely interdisciplinary
work, right?

83
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:09,620
Yes, definitely!

84
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:12,320
And a work where you have
no documenation.

85
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,760
There were no documents, you won't
find anything!

86
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:18,260
Well, back then there was no Wikipedia, but
in the Mus...

87
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:20,820
You didn't find anything in the encyclopedia...
We did not have anything!

88
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:24,500
Back then, Zuse gave us a few
written documents:

89
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,780
Am I saying, shorthand?
Well, we accepted it!

90
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:28,900
We couldn't do shorthand, so we took it
to the shorthand office:

91
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,660
The lady says as soon as
she looks at it:

92
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,080
Can you take it back with you!
Why what?

93
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,580
This is no standard shorthand, these are
other characters!

94
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,620
Then we went back
to Zuse:

95
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:39,500
You, what kind of shorthand is that here?
Yes, that's the...

96
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,700
Normal shorthand was for him...
How did he say it?

97
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:44,100
Not effective enough, he changed
the syntax a bit.

98
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:47,040
Of course that was "Game over!" for us!
(Michael laughs)

99
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,440
We returned the thing, you couldn't
do anything with it!

100
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,940
So we didn't have any documents, we
really started from scratch!

101
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,240
And that's what the first few weeks
looked like:

102
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:58,720
Worked to the max and didn't
bring anything to paper.

103
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,160
Where we finished with the thesis, I made
three crosses!

104
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,380
I was so glad that we got the
issue over with.

105
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:05,600
And then the following seven
months later,

106
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,040
where we were involved in the work, at
the machine...

107
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:10,760
I wouldn't say that it was more
more fun now....

108
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,560
It was fun before too.
But...

109
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,380
There was this burden of the thesis and having to
write in evening...

110
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:16,620
Was gone!

111
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:19,340
We were able to do a bit of sport again in the evenings,
we went out once in a while.

112
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:21,000
Before that we only sat
in the digs...

113
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,220
And we wrote until exhaustion in the
evening, went to bed...

114
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:28,100
And the next morning we started early again
and worked on the machine!

115
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:31,060
That was easier for us
later on.

116
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:33,700
Konrad Zuse was already seventy-eight
at the time...

117
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,720
What's also remarkable that one is
still so fit in this age!

118
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,680
Absolutely remarkable!
He was super fit!

119
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,320
So there was not a hint of dementia
to be noticed.

120
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,940
Or difficulties, or words
were missing...

121
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:47,540
Also his way of expression...
Legendary!

122
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:50,180
And you stayed in the town's
guest house!

123
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:52,860
So Hünfeld obviously had an
interest in it...

124
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:53,740
Yes!

125
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,480
He's an honorary citizen of Hünfeld, they
have a museum...

126
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:59,220
And we also got to know the mayor
during that time.

127
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:01,420
And they were also glad that
we did it

128
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:03,340
and did everything to make
our stay...

129
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,300
Pleasant, this must
be said!

130
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,020
The city of Hünfeld: Also in retrospect, I am
very grateful!

131
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:11,300
That was a... for us a good stay, there!
We had enough space!

132
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,620
It wasn't luxuriously
furnished...

133
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:18,180
With the simplest furniture: Tables, cupboards,
a small kitchenette.

134
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:21,060
But it was enough! And it was
free for us.

135
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:26,300
And it was back then as a student, who only
got BAföG on a credit basis...

136
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,120
Of course it was a gift. I have to say that
very clearly!

137
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,960
Many of our fellow
students...

138
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,180
Had to rent an apartment somewhere
in a foreign city...

139
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:33,680
And wrote a thesis there.

140
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,300
Completely different financial
prerequisites!

141
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,980
So it really was...
Very good!

142
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:39,140
May I ask how much each of you
got there?

143
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:39,580
Are you allowed to!

144
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:41,720
I would tell you directly if I still knew. I do
not know it anymore.

145
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,180
But it was lucrative!

146
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:46,520
So it was a decent salary in
D-Mark prices...

147
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:47,980
I think it was over a thousand
D-Marks!

148
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:49,380
But I really don't know how
much anymore!

149
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,720
There was a curatorship:
"Z1-Nachbau"

150
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,780
That sort of...

151
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:00,040
Took over the financing and
also...

152
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:03,540
I don't know...
Gave the support.

153
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:06,080
There was the GMD, which we
mentioned earlier.

154
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:11,460
Then Siemens, the Siemens company that had
taken over the Zuse KG back then.

155
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,260
Exactly!

156
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:16,320
And the "Museum für Verkehr und Technik",
today called "Technikmuseum"...

157
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:18,660
In Berlin!
That have been the three.

158
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:23,180
Did you have contact with any people
from these three groups?

159
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:26,400
Yes, with all three contacts, but only after the
first contact with...

160
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,580
Professor Dr. Schäfer (GMD), who arranged
the work for us.

161
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,100
When we finally had signed there and then
were on site...

162
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:35,420
We then drove to Hersfeld (Siemens) for
the inaugural visit.

163
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:37,020
Met the plant manager!

164
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:39,200
He was also happy and grateful that
we were doing this.

165
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,460
Because he has his...

166
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:43,220
skilled worker, employee...

167
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:45,020
I don't know, was his first name Ernst or
his last name Ernst?

168
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:47,160
I forgot that too after
34 years.

169
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:51,920
And he also supported us: he delivered the
metal sheets...

170
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:55,560
He took orders from us back to
Bad Hersfeld.

171
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:58,600
So Siemens has already helped
a lot too

172
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,000
ensure that things go forward with
the machine!

173
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,060
And then I also got to
know the...

174
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:04,020
I don't even remember his name,
Professor, this director

175
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:06,820
of the museum and he once came for a
visit to Hünfeld.

176
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:09,340
And he also made it clear to us that the
machine will go to Berlin!

177
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,980
Because Zuse is a Berliner.

178
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:14,920
And he would when the time
comes and the machine would be...

179
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:18,280
moved to Berlin, he'd invite us to
the inauguration.

180
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,220
Has he already made everything
palatable for us!

181
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:22,580
He was also in Hünfeld several times, we
got to know him.

182
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,900
And it started in 1988...

183
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:29,200
However, I read, for example, on the
website of Horst Zuse, 

184
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:33,360
Konrad Zuse's son, that there was already a
certain lead time...

185
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:38,400
Nineteen hundred...
He writes it already started in 1986 !

186
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,520
I can not judge that,
but it is possible!

187
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,440
The machine was already standing there
when we arrived.

188
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,620
The machine was already
standing there?

189
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:46,680
So the scaffolding, the first levels...
Ah what?

190
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:49,180
Yes, so it wasn't at zero!
That was also...

191
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:52,380
Zuse was already working on it, also with this
Siemens employee:

192
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:55,880
Herr Ernst, or Ernst as his first name...
I can't remember!

193
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:58,280
And the two have already carried
out some work.

194
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,960
That was clear, this curatorship was already
up and running!

195
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:04,160
We came to that later! Because the
idea was born:

196
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,740
With two students, you would of course
have a few more workers.

197
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:09,960
They could also document this: That was
the meaning behind it!

198
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,260
Completely understandable from
today's perspective!

199
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,080
We did that in the industry too,
to some extent.

200
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,160
And when we came to this studio for
the first time...

201
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:20,240
Then the pins were already there, this base
frame with the motor on the side.

202
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,640
And all the cups with the individual
parts were there.

203
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,160
And we were just amazed: This is going
to be a computer?

204
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,260
Well, that's right, the preparatory
work...

205
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:30,860
I don't know whether that was in 1986 or 87,
Horst will know this better...

206
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:34,700
Whom we also met in Berlin back then... 
Personally!

207
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,540
This may be true, that's
all correct!

208
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,820
So the machine was already under construction,
no question about it.

209
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:43,680
What I saw in Munich, there is a memory
model of the Z1.

210
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,960
I don't know if you ever...
I didn't see that!

211
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,700
I was in Munich before I wrote my
diploma thesis, so far...

212
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:51,140
I haven't been to the "Deutsches Museum"
since then, 30 years.

213
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:52,260
I definitely need to go back
there again!

214
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:55,640
Yes, yes, there is a model with the memory
and I think that

215
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:59,180
was also a preparatory work
for the replica.

216
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:01,340
But I would have to research
that again!

217
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:04,080
That could have been a
preparatory work.

218
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,100
It's now in the "Deutsches Museum"!

219
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:09,500
And then you said: Okay, they've actually
built something up there.

220
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,540
The frame stood.
Yes!

221
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:13,860
Strangely enough, the motor is already on
at the beginning...

222
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,220
(Michael laughs)
Exactly!

223
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:17,640
I never understood why did the
machine get a motor?

224
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,140
It was easy to turn
by hand,

225
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:22,280
and if there was a defect you simply felt it
in your hand:

226
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,060
Oops, something's wrong here!

227
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:25,220
Pulled back before the metal sheet was 
completely bent...

228
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,660
And the motor would never have felt that,
it would have slipped!

229
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,800
It was said that there was a
torque limiter, but...

230
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,580
It's not as sensitive as a
human being!

231
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:32,900
Well, I was of the opinion that
the motor...

232
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,080
We never put it into
operation either.

233
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,900
Not when we were there: The motor did not
run even once!

234
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,880
But right at the
beginning...

235
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,840
It was attached, on both sides! Fat mechanical
engineering three-phase motor...

236
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:46,200
Complete madness!
(Michael laughs)

237
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,620
Yes and...

238
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:50,800
Well...

239
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:58,600
Then the... thesis was called
“GMD Paper 321”...

240
00:10:59,040 --> 00:10:59,720
Yes!

241
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:06,020
Functional and construction principles of the program-controlled mechanical calculating machine “Z1”

242
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:09,260
Yes, because the term computer was not
known at the time...

243
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:11,360
1936, when Zuse built the machine.

244
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,321
For him it was a calculating machine, but
the special thing

245
00:11:14,321 --> 00:11:15,100
was that it was

246
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,820
freely programmable!
That means...

247
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:21,340
You could combine the arithmetic operations
in your own order.

248
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,460
And in the binary system!

249
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:27,120
But the term computer came up later. That's
why  for him it was a:

250
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,140
Freely programmable calculating machine! 
That's what's behind it.

251
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:33,380
And...

252
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:37,080
I would perhaps go into the technology
a bit later...

253
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,260
But now maybe first back to the process,
how it went on.

254
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:42,560
You then built this machine...

255
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:48,960
It was tedious and in June 1989
it was finished!

256
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:50,480
Yes!

257
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,360
And...

258
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,440
How long did it take you
then in total?

259
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,740
Fourteen months! Fourteen months, then yes...

260
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:58,220
Yes, it was the diploma thesis that ran
for six months.

261
00:11:58,220 --> 00:11:59,920
We got through that with...

262
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,640
I wouldn't say "by the skin of one's teeth", but managed to
get through at the last minute

263
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,100
that we meet to the six
months.

264
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,760
That was also such a deadline at the
university back then.

265
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,020
Oh, was a hard limit?

266
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:09,560
Yes, we had three months for the actual
standard diploma thesis.

267
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:12,160
We then got a three-month extension, that
became clear pretty quickly.

268
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,600
And even for that it was hard
to comply with.

269
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,900
We really have been working day and night
over the last few weeks.

270
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:20,640
Uschi's sister then read and
proofread.

271
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,420
I also had some who
proofread.

272
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:23,940
And then we submitted it...

273
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:26,100
And that was the topic... the six
months were up.

274
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:31,140
And quick question: I mean here we have
this GMD paper now...

275
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:33,100
No, that's the original!
Oh, is this the original here?

276
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,840
The original diploma thesis...

277
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:37,320
This is the GMD paper,
only thinner!

278
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,000
Oh...
But this is the original!

279
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,920
Oh, that is the original?
Yes!

280
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:43,100
And that's it, that's thicker,
the original...

281
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:45,240
That's because the drawings are
folded in there.

282
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:48,620
The original black-and-white photos are pasted in,
which of course also thickens...

283
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:51,860
Eighty grams of paper is taken
and...

284
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:55,680
This is a bit thinner paper and everything is printed,
so it's also thinner!

285
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:59,780
Is the diploma thesis then copied one to one
in the GMD paper,

286
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:01,940
or was it reworked again?

287
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:04,880
These folded drawings that we have in here...
I'll pull them out...

288
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:07,660
It's DIN-A3, we folded it
according to DIN...

289
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:10,120
They're not shown in
that way there!

290
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:13,520
Otherwise in terms of content: I don't think
anyone corrected anything.

291
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:16,980
Hardly anyone could correct it technically,
because it was a single piece.

292
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:19,520
That was also the problem for our professor at
the colloquium.

293
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,560
What is he trying to ask us?

294
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:24,080
He can ask us questions, but he
can't...

295
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,560
Check our answer for
plausibility.

296
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,860
Is it true what Ms. Schweier and he, Mr. Saupe,
are telling us?

297
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,740
Because the thing wasn't
documented!

298
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:32,840
He also admitted that, it was difficult for him.

299
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,520
In this case Mr. Zuse should have
been there!

300
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:37,160
So to speak, exactly! And he wouldn't
have done that.

301
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,720
What nonsense! According to
the motto:

302
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,380
I want to build the machine and not
write any paper here!

303
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:43,560
That's your problem from
the university.

304
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:46,400
Well, the colloquium was in fact funny when I remember,
that was...

305
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,860
We told them more than they
could ask anything.

306
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,800
May I ask what grade
you got?

307
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,260
Yes, you may, it was an A, a straight one!
Wow! Yes!

308
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,400
And if you write the paper together,
do you get...

309
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,380
Do both get the same grade?
Yes, yes, definitely!

310
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:04,520
So, in for a penny, in for a pound! So if it
went wrong, or we

311
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:07,240
made serious mistakes and we
got a D or E,

312
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,620
that would have been for both of us,
that's clear!

313
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:12,440
Well, you really have to...
As a team you are...

314
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:15,820
Either you reap the laurels or you lose,
both is possible!

315
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:20,340
But we were relatively satisfied at the
end of the work

316
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:22,400
as far as the documentation of the memory unit
was concerned: 

317
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:25,440
And we were aware that we had
documented that properly.

318
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:29,180
And we had two proofreaders...
And then we knew already:

319
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:30,720
Okay, that's not wrong!

320
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,040
But we were also aware that it is
incomplete...

321
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,780
Half the machine is documented, and namely
the easier part.

322
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:39,240
And that was already clear, after that
everyone talked at us:

323
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,720
Also do this execution unit!
Yes.

324
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,480
And we responded: How should
we and when?

325
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,840
And we're back at the machine
working all day!

326
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,500
And we both were...

327
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,680
Yes ok, "fed up" is the
wrong word...

328
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,800
But we wanted... after all the work,
after completing

329
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,280
the machine, it was clear to us, now
it's time for industry!

330
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:57,240
And we both wanted to work!

331
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:01,280
In a normal job! And that wasn't a topic
for either of us!

332
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:04,500
But it is also clear if we had
done it there...

333
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:07,860
We definitely would have managed to document
the execution unit.

334
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:09,960
If, for example, at that time from the
university of applied sciences a

335
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:13,940
doctorate had been possible and the
GMD had paid for it...

336
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,680
I think that would have
gone differently!

337
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,140
But at that time it was said that a university of
applied sciences cannot do a doctorate!

338
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:21,300
In that case you would have had to do the
Master of Science in England.

339
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,660
And so we said straight away: No, come on
guys, just leave it!

340
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,680
Yes, otherwise we probably would
have done it!

341
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,720
At least I could imagine.

342
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,680
I don't know how Uschi would think about it or
would have thought about it, but...

343
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,620
 

344
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:33,720
We had accomplished that too, why not?
That would have been...

345
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,860
That would have been good!

346
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:37,680
And I've also seen the machine
several times:

347
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,180
It looks super complicated, so...
It's definitely complicated!

348
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:43,500
Doesn't only look like it,
it's complicated!

349
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,100
And how many metal sheets are in
operation at the same time...

350
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:49,280
And have to follow the clock signals, these four
cycles of the machine...

351
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,340
Unbelievable, well....

352
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:54,460
Well, I thought in between: Boa, it will
never work, this will not work!

353
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:55,820
I seriously thought that!

354
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:58,340
I wasn't sure and Zuse also made
some mistakes.

355
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:00,840
Uschi recognized them at
some point!

356
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:01,920
And then I thought:

357
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,780
God, if this goes on like this,
it will never work!

358
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:06,240
And at some point we won't have
enough time anymore.

359
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,880
I was then concerned that one would ever get
out of the project.

360
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:13,200
It was also a moral thing to stay with it
until the end.

361
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,360
And then...

362
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,240
At some point we got our act together,
the three of us!

363
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,740
And then it worked better
and better.

364
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:21,540
The errors were fewer and fewer and then the
first test calculation ran...

365
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:23,700
And lo and behold:
It finally worked!

366
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,760
Insanity!
Yes I said too. Insanity!

367
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,420
So did you just stand there with
your mouth open?

368
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:28,000
Yes!

369
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,740
So the day it ran for the first time and
the trial calculation.

370
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:35,028
And we had calculated our results with the
pocket calculator beforehand...

371
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:36,680
And we turn and crank...

372
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,400
And everything was right from the noise
point of view.

373
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:41,400
And then at some point idle mode, presentation of results...
I walk over to the display:

374
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,060
was the number we had expected!

375
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:46,300
Insanity! It's like a wonder,
isn't it?

376
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:49,320
Today one would say: Give me five! Sort of, right?

377
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,740
Didn't you make something with Zuse...
No, we didn't!

378
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:54,560
Zuse wasn't the type for it either, he was emotionally
like, hands on his back:

379
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:56,060
"Well, that's quite nice then!"

380
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:57,800
Then he left again, hands on his
back again.

381
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,420
Such sober comments. He wasn't
an emotional guy!

382
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:02,420
Not an emotional type?
No no! He'll be...

383
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:04,940
I'm sure he'll have been terribly
happy inside.

384
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:10,060
A burden has been lifted from him too! Because he...
worked on the machine every day...

385
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:12,560
So the theory too: He went down to his
living room...

386
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,960
He didn't take a break and drank coffee
and read the newspaper,

387
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,740
instead he hung around
with the plans.

388
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:20,680
And he did that also on Saturday and Sunday! So that
was an all-round job for him.

389
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:25,340
And it has to be said that he also had a
mild heart attack during that time.

390
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:27,320
So he was also away for a
few weeks...

391
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,320
And that would have been the
end of our work

392
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,520
if he had died now, to
put it bluntly!

393
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,580
What should you have documented? That would have
been the end of the road!

394
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:36,160
It wouldn't have been possible
without him!

395
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:41,060
Clearly, he deserves the honor that he managed to
do it all at that age...

396
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,340
Insanity!
I still admire him for that today!

397
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:45,180
But maybe it wouldn't have worked
without you either...

398
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:46,580
Yes, some people said that.

399
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:50,080
We put a bit more speed into it,
we documented.

400
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:54,000
Because the skilled worker or the
other people involved

401
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,960
who were somehow working in the background
did no documentation.

402
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,540
That was in fact the diploma thesis,
one must say quite clearly!

403
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:02,200
Perhaps two more people should have been
taken in parallel...

404
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:05,000
Doctoral students who would then have taken
care of the execution unit.

405
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,420
We have also calcul... it several times... reported
several times to the curatorship

406
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:13,140
that the documentation of the execution unit
currently comes to nothing.

407
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:16,660
Nobody is there and the...
The whole machine

408
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:20,900
ultimately lives from the three of us from the head and the depositing plate.

409
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:24,680
Plus those plans that exist, but there's no
proper documentation.

410
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:28,160
We said that infinitely often, also
with the museum.

411
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,400
Then they later gave us
an employee.

412
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,260
He came to us in Hünfeld from
the museum...

413
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:38,220
And he also worked with us. It was
already an older colleague.

414
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:41,400
And he couldn't catch up with
the lead we had.

415
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:45,260
That means he did not acquire this deep knowledge in time.

416
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:49,940
And that's why the machine is in that condition
in the museum as it is today.

417
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,920
How exactly did the execution
unit worked?

418
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:56,460
We didn't know it in detail either, that was Zuse's 
knowledge in his head...

419
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,780
Mmh...
And that's missing!

420
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:02,380
It's also unbelievable for me to keep something
like that in mind...

421
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:04,800
And then also the translation into
the mechanics...

422
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,080
Yes, and to always keep the four
clock cycles!

423
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,300
You have to do all the...
We have a model here:

424
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:11,480
the right impulses at
the right time.

425
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:15,140
If that doesn't work and it makes the wrong impulse, 
the metal will crack.

426
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,580
We've seen that often
enough!

427
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:18,080
He had to keep that in
mind too!

428
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,940
That means not only transferring
the logic,

429
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:22,220
but also applying the
mechanics so

430
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:24,900
that they come with the right impulse and
at the right time.

431
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:25,920
Incredible!

432
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,940
You always notice a bit of backlash here.
Exactly!

433
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:30,120
And...

434
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:34,820
And that was a bit of a problem in the end,
because...

435
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,300
The backlashes sum up!

436
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:39,140
And when you have an arithmetic operation,
depending on how complex it was,

437
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:43,680
you had to pass on the impulse via an incredible
number of metal sheets and pins.

438
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:47,060
And if you lose a few hundredths, let's say even tenths,
on every pulse.

439
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,980
I can't remember how much
it was exactly.

440
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:51,620
Then at the end only two millimeters arrived
instead of three millimeters.

441
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:54,600
And there was the pen halfway up.
And that was the crackling!

442
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:56,860
And if you were lucky and you
had an operation

443
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:59,880
or a calculation that didn't take that
many pulses,

444
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:02,720
then the machine ran
wonderfully.

445
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,120
That was also the reason why sometimes
it went super well

446
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,280
and other times it was choppy. And this
is the backlash!

447
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:11,220
A kind of “booster” would have had to
be built in,

448
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:14,520
standardizing every movement, so to speak,
bringing it to a fixed value.

449
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,580
That would have been the
improvement

450
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:19,100
if the machine had been
optimized again.

451
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,120
I haven't understood that
yet...

452
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:23,120
So you have an impulse, eight millimeters
as an example.

453
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,180
So an impulse that pushes the metal sheet
eight millimeters.

454
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:28,380
Exactly, from the circular movement to a
translational movement.

455
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,660
I don't know the number of
millimeters anymore...

456
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:32,880
But let's say it was
eight millimeters.

457
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,320
And due to the backlash of
individual pins,

458
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:37,880
only 6.8 millimeters arrive in the end
instead of eight.

459
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,980
Then it goes through just fine,

460
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:43,220
because the pen is already more than halfway over it,
over the next impulse sheet.

461
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:46,260
And that could have been
avoided by

462
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:49,500
always normalizing every...
Every movement to these eight millimeters.

463
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,800
With a spring, so to speak!
Oh...

464
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,840
That you always bring them to
the end stop.

465
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,220
That you let it snap with a spring, so to speak.
Exactly!

466
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:58,320
I know it today from the bicycle technology,
they do that a lot.

467
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:01,040
Our ratchet mechanism:

468
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,580
There is also a retainer tab and so that it
fits again, it

469
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:06,620
is equipped with a spring that always pulls
it to the end stop.

470
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:08,400
And that could have been done here too.
Okay.

471
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,240
Bring each sheet of metal to the end stop with a
spring, so to speak, so

472
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:14,520
that the real 8 millimeters fit, switch
on briefly...

473
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:18,200
And then bring every impulse to this
end stop again and again.

474
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:22,680
I'll call that a "booster" or...
moving up to a standard value.

475
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,020
Then I think it would have been
much more stable!

476
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:27,220
And the high level of accuracy that we had back then,
everything was wire eroded to

477
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:30,620
hundredths and they were super accurate! So the
measuring machines...

478
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:32,420
If you had eight with
a caliper gauge...

479
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:35,960
It was exactly eight, it was incredible
how precisely they eroded.

480
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:40,020
And the pins were pins from a rolling-element bearing,
so they were hardened steel pins.

481
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:43,680
So eroded, you explained that in
your talk.

482
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:46,460
You have some kind of EDM machine there...
Or how was it called?

483
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:46,960
Yes!

484
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,000
Yes, it's called a EDM machine. Basically a
copper wire that

485
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,320
runs long and carries electricity.

486
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,440
Has a stream of water around it.

487
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,760
And, like a welding process,
it burns

488
00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:01,820
off the metal sheets to be processed and then
continues moving in the meantime.

489
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:05,500
So this wire runs down and the XY movement
is done by a CNC machine.

490
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,040
And so the shapes were cut out.

491
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,820
Is the apparatus heated?

492
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:10,860
Not heated, but the heat came from the
current flow.

493
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:11,920
Yes by the current flow?
Yes!

494
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,560
Then it gets hot, the wire...
It gets hot, that's right!

495
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:16,380
And so that it doesn't break, it's
constantly pulled...

496
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:19,160
That's right! Exactly, the worn wire was
also very rough...

497
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:21,120
It wasn't as thick as it was at
the beginning.

498
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,780
And that was the wear and tear of the machine,
so to speak.

499
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:26,240
That was always a worn out wire that
was wound up.

500
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:30,980
It was then taken for recycling and the original wire
was, so to speak, the...

501
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:34,560
Like a welding wire that goes by and it took
away material.

502
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,120
You probably had a look
at that, right?

503
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:38,820
Yes, we were also allowed to write
single NC programs.

504
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:41,400
That was also part of the diploma thesis, but
we were interested in it too!

505
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,340
And the plant manager was super kind! He
then also said:

506
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:45,540
Do you want to program yourself, a few
sheets of metal?

507
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:46,200
And then we responded:
Yes, of course!

508
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,000
And then they showed us
how to do it.

509
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,700
We then programmed a few
metal sheets ourselves.

510
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,420
It was a machine control with
"G-code"...

511
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:55,640
I remember exactly how all these
individual codes worked.

512
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:56,840
And...

513
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,820
The accuracy was outstanding! And that
was probably also

514
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:02,260
the reason why Zuse said, we don't
need a booster

515
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:04,620
or any stop, but the accuracy
is enough!

516
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:06,380
Should be enough, but barely
wasn't enough...

517
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:09,460
Exactly, because during the run there
were simply too many...

518
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:11,140
Perhaps the hardened steel pin
also afflicted

519
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:13,680
this stainless steel sheet, so that there
were already indentations.

520
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,920
It could also be that the sheet metal
has worn out.

521
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:20,300
Of course, it was also an unequal
pair of partners...

522
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:23,780
Hardened steel versus... versus stainless steel,
which it is soft.

523
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:25,840
What was stainless steel and what was
hardened steel?

524
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,480
The sheet metal is stainless steel. Quite normal, you could
work with a file.

525
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,580
Not rusting is the advantage!

526
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:32,140
And the steel pin that's in there in
the front...

527
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:33,620
Maybe you can see it in
the camera...

528
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,900
That's a hardened steel pin from a
rolling-element bearing.

529
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,960
And of course it is clear that the partner always wins.

530
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:41,240
Because it's harder?
Yes, of course, because it's harder...

531
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:44,120
And that was a mistake too? One had
perhaps then...

532
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,300
It is not a mistake in this respect:
Firstly, it was inexpensive,

533
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,140
there are large quantities available
of this pen.

534
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:49,580
It always has the same
dimensions...

535
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:51,740
And I would have done
that too!

536
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:53,760
And you accept the fact that
it's harder:

537
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,800
Before you get an indentation to the metal
sheet, you have to have thousands of hits.

538
00:23:56,800 --> 00:24:00,080
I don't know how many times the museum
actually ran the machine.

539
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,580
I can only guess, I have
no idea!

540
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:04,200
Yes, that... I would like to...

541
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,720
I actually wanted to come up with this later,
but we can do it right away.

542
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,280
Well, the machine became...
Exactly, it became...

543
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:14,180
You finished it and then it was transported
to the...

544
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,080
"Museum für Verkehr und Technik" namely...

545
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,620
Maybe let's continue with that
for a moment:

546
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:23,500
There you somehow got it over from
the studio with a rather...

547
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:28,500
daring action then with a...
crane somehow...

548
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,620
I've only seen it in the film.

549
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:32,060
And we were both already out of work...
Oh!

550
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:35,600
I think we stopped in February,
in February 1989.

551
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:39,060
We both started our jobs on the
first of March.

552
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:43,560
Me at the Daimler in Stuttgart.
And...

553
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:46,700
By this time, we had already left and the
machine was finished.

554
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,760
And it was then taken away in the course of
the summer and then

555
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:53,640
presented to the public in the museum in September and
handed over in a ceremony.

556
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:57,340
Riesenhuber was there too, along with
all the renowned scientists.

557
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:00,980
And the transport went like this: The pane
was taken out of the studio.

558
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:04,980
None of them could be swivelled, they were
fixed fixed in a frame.

559
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:08,020
They were taken out and afterwards a crane
was used above the house...

560
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:10,520
The machine was then pushed over on a
pallet like that.

561
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:11,660
That was on the other side...
Yes!

562
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:13,700
That wasn't on the street side?
Exactly!

563
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:16,140
The studio was at the back,
facing the garden,

564
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:19,280
big garden, outside at the back, had a meadow
with a few fruit trees.

565
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:22,020
And then the machine was hoisted out
and then

566
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:25,380
over the roof, put onto the street, so to speak,
on the transporter.

567
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,840
I only saw it in the film from
this Mathias Knauer.

568
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:30,800
This film documentary team that shot
everything back then...

569
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,020
And then it was clear to me:
Oh, that's how they did it!

570
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:34,040
Because I've always wondered:

571
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,940
How are they going to get the machine
out of here?

572
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:37,860
Because the staircase was way
too small...

573
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:40,020
I don't even know how they got the
machine in there.

574
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:43,680
I assume that it was welded together
there in 1986/87.

575
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,460
Also a good question, I don't know how
was it brought in?

576
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:49,920
It just stood there!
Probably...

577
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:54,200
They probably mounted it there!
Yes, I suppose so too, yes, yes!

578
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:58,460
Well, and then it was handed over to the
"Technikmuseum".

579
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:02,080
And there was also a demonstration, kind of
an official...

580
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,160
A celebration too, I suppose.... Yes!
Were you there too?

581
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,560
Yes, we were invited. It was a
big celebration!

582
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08,520
First of all, we spent a few days in the
museum beforehand.

583
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:13,100
We stayed there in their guest room because we have the machine...

584
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:16,200
when it was transported there, unpacked again, so to speak,

585
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:18,620
everything configured, does
everything work?

586
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:22,500
And then the film crew came too:
Mathias Knauer and Emil Zopfi.

587
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,480
And then shot the final act.

588
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,820
And a few additional film sequences were also
shot in the museum...

589
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,500
And there we were present
as well.

590
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,960
That is, that was also part
of our job:

591
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:35,200
Hand over to the museum, do the test calculation,
finish the film...

592
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:38,240
And then came the official part with the
handover ceremony...

593
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,280
There is a sequence in the
film where...

594
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:44,640
I think Riesenhuber was there and
gave a speech,

595
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,940
Zuse himself had his say. It was a
ceremonial handover.

596
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,660
It was quite a ceremony, it has
to be said.

597
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:52,820
The Minister of Education Riesenhuber...
Or what was his name?

598
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:54,340
Research Minister...
Research Minister!

599
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:58,460
Yes, with the bow tie!
Oh, right! The one back then! Yes!

600
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:00,980
Ah yes and...
I once heard...

601
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:05,600
I think Professor Rojas wrote that
somewhere once:

602
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:09,980
That during the presentation the calculation
would not have worked.

603
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:14,180
Okay, at least I wasn't there.
I don't know.

604
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:15,360
It may have been at
the museum.

605
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,760
But you have been at the... with the... with this...
with this...

606
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,640
During the official part, the machine was
in fact running...

607
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:23,880
So at this official act with the minister, the
machine was running then?

608
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:24,460
Well...

609
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:26,700
When the minister came and gave
the speech,

610
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:30,060
we didn't run the machine, but days before,
in the museum itself!

611
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:33,520
Where the professor... Aeh... the... the... the...
director was there.

612
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,620
For the film crew,
we did it....

613
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:38,120
Then we covered the machine again
with plexiglass.

614
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:41,560
And at the ceremony itself, the machine has not been run.

615
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:46,620
There was only the speech, Zuse's handover to the...
the Museum...

616
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:48,200
And what did he say as the
final sentence?

617
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,920
Learn how to invent a computer where
none exists yet!

618
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:54,540
Or something analogous to that. And that was the
end of the ceremony.

619
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:56,780
And there we did not do
any calculation.

620
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:59,520
But it is clear that also during the time
in Hünfeld...

621
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:02,820
During specific trial calculations
it got stuck.

622
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:05,480
It didn't always go through.
That was also our...

623
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:08,480
Fear and worry that when we hand it over
to the museum,

624
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,520
when the film crew comes, it
get stuck again

625
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,260
and then we have to tinker around for
hours again.

626
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:15,700
That is why I would not contradict this...
Mr Rojas!

627
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:19,020
It may be that he was there at a trial calculation
where it was hanging.

628
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,540
That was the fate of the Z1!

629
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:25,280
The mechanical accuracy was not such
that it always ran.

630
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:26,520
One thing is clear!

631
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:30,000
If it went through and gave a result, the
result was never wrong!

632
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:32,340
So you can't imply that the...

633
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:35,120
built-in subtraction in the
control unit or...

634
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:38,720
This addition or subtraction, division... The combination...

635
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,640
That they wouldn't have delivered
the right result....

636
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,780
We have not experienced that! That has
always been correct!

637
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:46,100
Yes, but that's already a great result
in my opinion.

638
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:49,920
That you finish this complicated work in
such a way

639
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:52,220
that it works in principle!
Exactly!

640
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:54,980
And that was, after all, the purpose of
the curatorship:

641
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:58,040
Can we now prove with modern
means in 1988,

642
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:01,740
that Zuse was already right with his idea in 1936?
That was the basic idea.

643
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:04,900
And that can definitely be affirmed, he was
right with his theory!

644
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:08,500
The machine basically worked! That was
definitely the case.

645
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,460
But the mechanics is the
wrong way!

646
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:13,140
I would like to describe a case when we
have experienced a defect

647
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:16,380
on the machine in the construction phase or later
in the test phase:

648
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,680
Uschi or me, we were cranking...

649
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,460
One of us has cranked, the other
has operated....

650
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,320
And then there was a strange
noise...

651
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:24,560
And the one at the crank
noticed immediately:

652
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,180
Oops, something's wrong here!

653
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:28,320
Then it was time for troubleshooting...
Where is it stuck?

654
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:31,280
That means going into the metal sheets again and again, into the movement....

655
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,940
And I then looked into
the layers...

656
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:35,420
Looked where the sheet metal
bends up somewhere....

657
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:38,600
You can see that in the sheets, they start jumping up like that.

658
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,680
You can also see that here in the...
In the model quite well:

659
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:43,820
If such a force arrives here now, then
the whole thing goes up like this!

660
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,260
Aaah!

661
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:47,960
And then we first had to find out in
which...

662
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:50,580
module is the problem in the first place.
You heard that from the noise.

663
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:53,040
Then you knew, either memory unit, which
was less common....

664
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:55,240
There were more mistakes in the
execution unit!

665
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,640
Good, then we found
the block.

666
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,540
Now it must come from here, you could
feel it too....

667
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:00,300
Then looked, where? Oh, yes, down here,
I see it...

668
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:02,000
The pin, it's wobbling here! Level three!

669
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:03,000
Okay!

670
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:06,420
Everything stopped: We knew at what clock cycle
the whole thing was....

671
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:09,700
Screws unscrewed, depositing
plate fetched...

672
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:13,020
Sheet metal put down, first sheet metal put down,
second, third sheet metal...

673
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:16,700
I don't want to exaggerate: It took you
hours to get to that spot....

674
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:19,480
So three four hours putting down metal
sheets were not unusual!

675
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:22,680
Because you have to take out every part,
every pin, every spacing sleeve.

676
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:24,580
And then you are at the level and
then you see:

677
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:26,240
Okay, the sheet metal is stuck!
Why?

678
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,340
And then we cranked
again slightly:

679
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:29,960
Either it was a impulse error...

680
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:32,360
We had errors of reasoning or Zuse
had them...

681
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:35,240
We have virtually constructed metal sheets
according to false drawings!

682
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:38,940
Or it was a mechanics problem again, because the impulses again...

683
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:42,620
Well, the subject of the addition of impulses...
There were various reasons for that.

684
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:45,960
Then looked at the sheet metal, examined it
as a locksmith:

685
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:48,200
Is it still in the elastic range
the deformation?

686
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:51,500
Or is it already plastically deformed,
with a kink?

687
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:54,060
Then it's clear that the sheet metal has
to be brought in again!

688
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:56,700
Then we called Siemens:
Colleague Ernst came...

689
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:58,980
We gave the sheet metal to take with him, 
he knew in which program it was in:

690
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:03,480
They must have had loads of programs too,
back then at Siemens in Bad Hersfeld.

691
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:06,660
He wire eroded the sheet metal
and we have reinstalled it.

692
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,760
And as I said, there were
various errors:

693
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:12,480
A logical error: That the impulse came
at the wrong time...

694
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,440
Then we corrected that:

695
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:14,500
In the plan!

696
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,260
In the CAD model!

697
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:17,520
In reality!

698
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:18,480
Built in!

699
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,420
Carried on...

700
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:22,700
Or a so-called sliding error:

701
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:25,140
Because the impulse was simply not far enough,
that happened too.

702
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:26,160
Those were more difficult,
those cases,

703
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:29,960
because you knew it could come back!
In that case the idea was,

704
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:32,580
to avoid this kind of arithmetic operations,
or this kind of...

705
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:35,760
As I said, we had programs that were more
vulnerable than other programs.

706
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,360
This is simply the issue with addition of
the backlashes!

707
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:42,800
Well, and now that we're on
the subject...

708
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:47,560
What I would also be interested in is
the workflow, so in principle:

709
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:50,900
Konrad Zuse had the logic in his head.
Yes!

710
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:53,040
And he wrapped that up in
some syntax,

711
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,720
which he himself probably
had invented, or...?

712
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,540
Yes, must be like that! Because there was nothing else
available at the time...

713
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:58,180
Some kind of logic circuits?
Exactly!

714
00:31:58,180 --> 00:31:59,460
And...

715
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:01,400
They were taken from
you then?

716
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,820
Or by Uschi in that case probably
mostly then...?

717
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:04,680
Yes, yes!

718
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:07,620
And were translated into these sheet
metal cut-outs....

719
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:09,540
Exactly! Yes, you can say it
like that!

720
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:12,200
And Uschi somehow learned how
to translate that?

721
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,980
Right, so we were both hanging
over the plans....

722
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:18,120
Have tried to understand, what does he meanby that?
This symbolism. 

723
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,740
We also described this in our
diploma thesis:

724
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:22,840
Which symbol corresponds to which switch plate?
Ah, okay!

725
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:25,260
We have also documented that, that
is really documented!

726
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:29,320
And derived from that... The difficulty
was always that:

727
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:32,880
If you have seen such a circuit diagram:
Are the clock cycles correct?

728
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,620
Is it even possible at that
moment here...?

729
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:35,980
For example, this now, now it
won't work!

730
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:38,100
Only when the sheet metal is here, the
switching operation will work.

731
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:40,260
And you have to recognise that on the
circuit diagrams!

732
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:43,540
Because there were always Roman numerals:
Cycle II, cycle III, cycle IV.

733
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:47,180
And that was complicated to see from the
circuit diagrams:

734
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:48,880
Oops, that can't work like that!

735
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,240
Because the sheet metal is still on
that side!

736
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:53,960
And that... Uschi did simply well!

737
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:57,560
And then came... When we had that,
the logic...

738
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:01,280
And he also corrected mistakes! Zuse came
with the new plan...

739
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:04,560
From this, we then designed the
CAD sheets!

740
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,580
So that would be step three...
Step three!

741
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:08,800
So, you've done that on
paper first, right?

742
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,220
Yes, in that case I stay
on the computer!

743
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:12,640
I sat there at the computer with
the CAD program:

744
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:15,220
AutoCAD version 9 or 8, I can't
remember any more...

745
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:16,240
Ancient version!

746
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:19,820
And then I gave these drawings to my
colleague Ernst...

747
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:22,480
And they then turned it into a
EDM/CNC program.

748
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,320
And then the metal sheets came back a
few days later.

749
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:25,920
That was the workflow!

750
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,420
Okay, so logic circuit...

751
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:29,080
Logic circuit Zuse...

752
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:31,080
Uschi Instance is correcting...

753
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:35,400
Transferring, I was also already involved in the process of
making drawings out of it...

754
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:38,320
Drawings created on CAD, that's what we
usually did in the evening...

755
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:41,200
Or at the weekend. And then
plotted this drawing:

756
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,640
We had a nice plotter from
the GMD with us...

757
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:46,160
And then we gave them to the colleague
and he...

758
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:48,380
created the EDM/CNC program
out of it.

759
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:51,100
It was the case later that we didn't even have to write
what the dimensions those were...

760
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:53,580
Here is this L... This L-cutout...
It was standardised!

761
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:55,240
They then also knew the
metal sheets:

762
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:59,880
There was a fixed width, there was this shape,
it was always the same.

763
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:02,360
That is, it was relatively easy for us and
also for them.

764
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,620
They already had these individual
programs...

765
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:05,700
And he just duplicated them:

766
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:07,040
How many holes do you need?
Eight pieces!

767
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,880
Then he duplicated them eight times!

768
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:12,000
Then we all got into a routine!

769
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,300
But it was always the same:
Zuse, plans, hand-drawn...

770
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:19,640
Transferred: CAD program,
NC program...

771
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,340
And then the sheet metal delivery arrived!
It was later...

772
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:23,700
So in the best case it was done in
two or three days:

773
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:28,100
Colleague Ernst came in in the afternoon with a
box and brought us new sheets...

774
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:32,200
Which we sort of drew on Monday, he brought on
Wednesday or Thursday.

775
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,760
And then we built them in on
Fridays...

776
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,660
And there we were again one
step further!

777
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:36,800
Were there then also
idle times,

778
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,480
when you had to wait for new sheets to
finally arrive?

779
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:42,440
Ahh little, so they were super,
super fast!

780
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:44,960
As I already said, Siemens was
extremely generous!

781
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:46,620
So this...

782
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:47,640
I don't remember that...

783
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:49,380
They were always ready for us
and...

784
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:51,640
Even if special materials
were needed...

785
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:54,280
Anodised aluminium or
any springs...

786
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,720
Especially up in the
card reader...

787
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:58,160
They delivered everything, it was
unbelievable!

788
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,180
So there you could order
what you wanted.

789
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:03,540
No... We didn't have any real
idle time!

790
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:05,400
The idle times were more those...

791
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,880
that we discovered another error again and
had to dismantle again.

792
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,540
This was lost time!

793
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:12,300
So build down one level, look at the errors,
fix them..

794
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,960
Have the sheet metal made and rebuilt. That
could have been a week in between!

795
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:19,520
Actually I wanted to bring this topic
up later, but...

796
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:24,000
Nowadays you can do a lot more on the
computer than in the past...

797
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:24,500
This means...

798
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:27,680
You're a CAD expert, therefore you
know best, I suppose.

799
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:30,960
So how would one
do it today?

800
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,080
Yes, today the metal sheets
would be...

801
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:35,940
Each sheet individually would be such
a single piece, such a "part"...

802
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:38,360
I am now referring to the
CATIA program.

803
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:41,600
And then you would do an "assembly" like
this via a "product structure"!

804
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:44,000
And then you could also run a
proper kinematics.

805
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,260
This means that we could
theoretically...

806
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:49,700
What I do here with sheet metal
could be simulated!

807
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:52,260
If you could manage that, you could
sort of:

808
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:57,220
Putting his theory into CAD, checking whether it
works with kinematics...

809
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:59,300
However, this would be very resource
intensive because...

810
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:02,000
As I said, hundreds of sheets were moved
in the turning process.

811
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,860
Now that would be a really
strong computer,

812
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:06,000
who could manage that with a CAD
program like this.

813
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,920
But if you could do it, you would
have the certainty:

814
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:12,220
That's how it works! And the computer
knows no backlash!

815
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:13,700
When he says, eight millimeter
kinematics,

816
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:17,180
then he'll give you exactly 8, 0 0 0
down to the thousandth!

817
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,100
That would be indeed cool!

818
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:21,680
I also thought about that afterwards, years later,
when I was in my profession,

819
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,140
and got to know the CAD program, with
its kinematics:

820
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:27,980
Where we got a whole Wankel engine
running as an exercise,

821
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:29,840
with its elliptical shape, with
gear wheels.

822
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,380
That worked wonderfully!

823
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:34,800
Or a normal watch, an analogue watch
with second hand, minute...

824
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:39,140
We had to do a program as an exercise
in the CAD courses.

825
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:41,820
I thought to myself: Boa, you should have had
that at the time with Zuse!

826
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:44,180
That would have been another
amazing piece of work,

827
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:45,740
to build up the thing completely
theoretically.

828
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,500
And then it would have also
been documented!

829
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:50,440
While we are on the subject of
documentation again...

830
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:53,220
The film perhaps briefly:

831
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:56,020
Mathias Knauer, we had already mentioned
him a few times...

832
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:58,560
A filmmaker from Switzerland.

833
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,740
Strangely enough...?

834
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:02,820
Why the Swiss were awarded
the contract...

835
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:04,260
Who hired them, I don't know.

836
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:06,380
How the contact came about,
I don't know.

837
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:08,940
The film begins where they were driving
in the car to Hünfeld...

838
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:10,820
And there he also gave the date:

839
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:12,440
I mean, it would have
been 1987....

840
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,960
You'd have to ask Mathias...
He's still around in Zurich!

841
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,620
How he came to the project.

842
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:21,840
He has been with us from the beginning.
So that's the topic again:

843
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:25,020
They were at the start beforehand, they interviewed
Zuse where the work began....

844
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,480
They've heard that we're going in as
the diploma thesis...

845
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:30,540
They visited us, interviewed us...
Films, sequences...

846
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:31,220
And they were...

847
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:34,580
There were times when we were on site several
times a week, or several times a month...

848
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,540
And until the end!

849
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:39,120
Even when I was at work,

850
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:43,100
they have dubbed the voice recordings again
at my home in Sindelfingen.

851
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:45,200
So they were on the film for a
very long time.

852
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:48,120
I think it took over three years until the
film was finished.

853
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:51,760
And is also... So that's what the...

854
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:56,400
the current curator, Eva Kudrass, once
said to me...

855
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,960
From their point of view,
the only...

856
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:02,480
The only cinematic documentary
that exists,

857
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:05,240
where you can actually see
the Z1 running!

858
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:07,280
Yes, yes!
And I'm especially glad about that,

859
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,520
because the critics who don't believe it
can see it there.

860
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,160
Yes.

861
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,000
And...

862
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,580
We should have documented the calculation
much more, of course....

863
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:16,280
We now make the following calculation, we
had to select the numbers...

864
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:18,080
Then it would have been
even more proof!

865
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:20,000
The film crew did not have the
patience back then....

866
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,840
Because of course the calculation really
took several minutes!

867
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:24,060
At that time...

868
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:25,580
Through the numerous visits we
have had...

869
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:27,320
Also computer magazines were
also there.

870
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:29,440
Mathias has made many film
recordings...

871
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,920
It was clear to me: that's enough,
the proof!

872
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,540
We also had Siemens as board
members on site...

873
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:34,800
They were throwing numbers
at our heads:

874
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,180
We programmed them in,
let them run:

875
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,820
Result, correct!

876
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:40,180
That was enough for me and that was
completely clear to me that the...

877
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:42,020
all...

878
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:44,760
That was clear to everyone, it was
clear to me too....

879
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:48,340
But you're right, it wasn't captured that
way in the film....

880
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:50,100
They should have shot a
separate sequence...

881
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:53,100
Completely the half hour where the machine is running,
where we're cranking...

882
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:56,580
Walk around the machine...
Document everything completely!

883
00:38:56,580 --> 00:39:00,840
Did they maybe even let it run, the film,
and just cut it?

884
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,780
No!
So where we were there...

885
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:06,060
In the museum, he make the complete recordings,
of the complete calculation.

886
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:08,840
With the rail around it and
the lighting...

887
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,860
He did it completely after all because then...
No, no, slowly!

888
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:14,160
He already told us that we couldn't
show everything...

889
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:17,620
And there we have cranked, the camera was switched off!
Short before the result comes...

890
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:19,720
And then he said: Now switch on again!
And then the result came...

891
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:20,840
Ah, they've turned off the cameras...
Okay!

892
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:23,420
Exactly, because it was too long for him!
He is right, of course:

893
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:26,220
He had a guideline as to how long such
a film could run.

894
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:29,360
And he can't spend half an hour for a calculation,
showing where people are cranking.

895
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:31,640
That would have been boring
for the audience!

896
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:34,700
They wanted to learn something about Zuse,
about the replica...

897
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:35,800
I understand that on the
one hand.

898
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:39,560
And in between, of course, he was
there in our studio...

899
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:43,020
Has also seen the sample calculations,
has seen that it works.

900
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:45,620
He didn't always have the camera on,
it has to be said.

901
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:47,960
He also had his notepad with him once
and took notes.

902
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:50,900
He just stitched together the material as it
was required for his film.

903
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:54,280
But nobody doubted at the time that
it wouldn't work.

904
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:57,220
Because the sample calculations were running,
it was clear to everyone:

905
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:58,880
Okay, the machine works in principle!

906
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:04,000
And for me still almost a miracle,
because...

907
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,380
Depending on what you read...
For example on the website of

908
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:11,220
Horst Zuse is written that it should be
30,000 individual parts!

909
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:14,880
I have also read the number. I have never
recalculated, recounted it.

910
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:18,620
What's the point, no one asked for it. That would
have been madness too!

911
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,080
But...

912
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:23,640
May or may not be true. Also the ton?
No idea!

913
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,940
There were thousands of sheets,
that's definitely true!

914
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:29,920
Maybe he extrapolated it. And pins...
And pins.

915
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,120
Maybe Horst has extrapolated it. I don't know if
the number will come.

916
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:34,360
I can't deny it, but I can't negate
it either:

917
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,660
May be true, but it doesn't
have to be!

918
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:38,120
It's not that decisive from my
point of view either:

919
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:40,840
Whether it was 30,000, 32,000, 40,000...

920
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:42,180
(Dietmar shrugs his shoulders)

921
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:44,960
Well, numbers sometimes
fascinate people.

922
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:47,820
Yes...
As I said, no one asked for it...

923
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,840
But it would also be a real pain: When I
think back on it...

924
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:54,120
If you take every single part, including
these drive pins...

925
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:56,640
These little brass blocks, grub
screw inside.

926
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:59,280
For God's sake, these are... These are numbers,
these are...

927
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:03,760
You can only... calculate, but you
can't really count it!

928
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,600
That would be a punishing job, counting
the thing through.

929
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:09,920
Ok, then I have a few more questions
about the operation:

930
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:12,420
We have already said that there
were two cranks...

931
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:15,740
And you have to synchronize them somehow...
Absolutely, yes!

932
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:17,320
They were also connected...

933
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:18,980
They were even connected!

934
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:20,620
That was why there were two cranks,
because we had

935
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:23,520
built both units for themselves and tested
them for themselves.

936
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:27,660
That means you have had a crank for the memory unit: Addressing, putting in the numbers, works!

937
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:31,180
Execution unit: Operation, that's where the pin
has to come out, okay!

938
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:33,060
At some point in time
pushed together...

939
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:35,160
Then the cranks are also coupled.

940
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,760
There were little flanges screwed together
in the middle.

941
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:40,100
And then, when you turned one crank, the
other one moved with it.

942
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:42,120
But that the load does not go
over the bar,

943
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:44,860
we said, of course, we'll crank
both in sync.

944
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:45,900
That was the reason!

945
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:48,400
It's like when you ride a
tandem today.

946
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,420
Don't know if you've ever
ridden a tandem?

947
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:51,320
There are the chains also
firmly connected.

948
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:54,300
Theoretically, you can ride alone in a tandem,
the crank at the back turns with you.

949
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:56,640
But of course it's more convenient when
both pedal in sync.

950
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,240
It was the same with
this machine!

951
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:59,880
You say that they then...

952
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:02,600
If you haven't been paying attention, they
actually bent like that.

953
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,640
So there are definitely forces at work.
Yes!

954
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:07,140
So there must be quite a bit of
leverage somewhere...

955
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:08,540
Or... or how was it done?

956
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:11,120
You had a crank of, I can
only guess,

957
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:13,920
it was 20 centimetres of crank length.
This was...

958
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:18,560
From a rotary movement, pushing movements were
made at the bottom via an eccentric.

959
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,480
And this pushing movement was a
defined path!

960
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:23,940
I don't know the millimeter number by heart anymore,
how many millimeters there were.

961
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:26,840
And they were fed into the
machine via angles.

962
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:30,140
And then accumulated over pins, up to the last
metal sheet.

963
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:34,040
And there was already a lot of friction that
you had to overcome....

964
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:36,780
And that's why the required strength
was respectively high.

965
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:39,380
And yet you noticed when something
was stuck...

966
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:41,940
And then when you've been good and you've
let go straight away like that....

967
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:44,200
We both had a feeling for it at some point
Uschi and I....

968
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:47,740
Then we managed to stop before
anything broke.

969
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:50,200
And if people had come
there now...

970
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:52,800
And would have turned the crank without
the sensitive feeling...

971
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,320
They would have squashed everything,
of course!

972
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:57,520
Or even worse, connect the motor...
That would have been the end!

973
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:58,760
Well, I don't know if that happened
in the museum....

974
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:01,020
I don't want to imply anything,
I wasn't there...

975
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:03,400
But you had to crank carefully, that
was important!

976
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:05,480
And...

977
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:09,120
You already said that there was also
friction with the metal sheets...

978
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:12,160
Did you use any oil
or...?

979
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:15,220
We did not use oil for fear of
sticking.

980
00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:17,640
After all, it is also an adhesion force
with an oil:

981
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:19,940
When two liquids on a bare surface...
You know it...

982
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:23,260
You can lift it! And there you also have
this adhesion force.

983
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:25,840
So we used a powder,
for a while.

984
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:29,000
I mean, it would have been a Teflon spray, some kind of lubricant.

985
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,180
That also helped a bit!

986
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:31,640
That was a bit smoother again!

987
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:34,580
Yes, exactly. And then...

988
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:37,480
Well, after that you didn't had that with the
"Technik Museum" on the radar any more.

989
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:40,420
You were... you told me you were there once, fixing something?
Exactly!

990
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:43,640
I already started at Daimler Benz
on 1 March 1989...

991
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:48,360
Was also quickly in the job... Was involved
in the CAD track...

992
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:50,260
Have also given courses,
relatively soon.

993
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:53,940
And then came a call from the museum, in the
evening once again from the director:

994
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:56,840
Mr Saupe, you have to help us, the machine
is stuck!

995
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:58,940
We have tried to fix it, but we are not
able to cope with it.

996
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:00,240
Maybe you could jump in again.

997
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:02,480
And then I also flew there
once again:

998
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:05,480
On the weekend, Friday afternoon to
Berlin!

999
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:08,100
They paid for the flight and also put me up
in the museum.

1000
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:10,520
I have repaired the
machine once!

1001
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:14,460
It worked again, it was another
classic hang-up.

1002
00:44:15,140 --> 00:44:16,680
And I left them again...

1003
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:18,740
And then, a few weeks later, he
called again:

1004
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:20,720
And that's when I told him,
"Nah, now I really can't do it any more!"

1005
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:23,980
I was fully into the job and after five days...
And I also noticed:

1006
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:25,820
I have also mentally said goodbye to
the machine more and more.

1007
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:28,060
I had already noticed the last
time I was there:

1008
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:29,940
Oh dear, where was that again, what
was that again?

1009
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:34,240
You have your concentration on something
completely different at the new job....

1010
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:36,780
And in between there was already more
than a year...

1011
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:39,500
Or half a year in between, where I had worked
with the machine.

1012
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:41,720
Then it was clear to me, you don't want
that anymore,

1013
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:43,220
And at some point you won't be able to
do that anymore!

1014
00:44:43,220 --> 00:44:45,140
And then he accepted it too.

1015
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:47,420
They also tried to poach me at
the very beginning.

1016
00:44:47,420 --> 00:44:49,580
They wanted me to get into'
the museum.

1017
00:44:49,580 --> 00:44:52,580
Sure, it would have been ideal for them! I also understand
that from his point of view.

1018
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:55,880
But at 27, I didn't want to work at
the museum, really...

1019
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:59,440
I told him the same thing: "No, by any stretch of the imagination,
I don't want that!"

1020
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:01,160
He then accepted that.

1021
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:04,200
So I was there once, that's right! I made it
work again...

1022
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:05,900
And the next time I was
already gone.

1023
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:08,400
And whether it was already stuck from
then or later, I don't know!

1024
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:12,240
It's now super hard to get the machine
running again, so...

1025
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:15,960
I think even if I could get it in there
again mentally...

1026
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:18,960
So many measures have now already
been made after the fact,

1027
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,980
makes the thing extremely
difficult to repair!

1028
00:45:20,980 --> 00:45:23,140
The memory unit would be even more
likely to be fixed.

1029
00:45:23,140 --> 00:45:26,360
Because that was somehow more systematic,
that was more logical.

1030
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:28,660
There wasn't that much addition of
movements there either.

1031
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:29,900
It has always been like that:

1032
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:33,640
A large push rod went through all the memory units,
and a few pins were pulled.

1033
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:35,460
Up and back again.

1034
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:37,340
In the execution unit, it was much
more complicated:

1035
00:45:37,340 --> 00:45:41,060
There also went the movements across the levels down,
up again to the next unit.

1036
00:45:41,060 --> 00:45:42,840
There were an incredible number of
blocks involved!

1037
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:45,260
But to repair the machine
completely...

1038
00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:48,120
That she could do these sample calculations, this proof today...

1039
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:50,060
Phew...

1040
00:45:50,060 --> 00:45:52,820
Hats off, if someone dares that, he will
need a lot of patience and time!

1041
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:55,620
And you have to be a stubborn...

1042
00:45:55,620 --> 00:45:59,340
Have a stubborn will and don't let
anyone dissuade you.

1043
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:02,280
And again down to the last level by
dismantling eleven pieces.

1044
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:04,180
This is just a terrible job!

1045
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:06,240
You don't want to do that to
anyone, but....

1046
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:08,340
The machine was set up that way, we
had no other choice!

1047
00:46:08,340 --> 00:46:09,960
It had to go that way!

1048
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:12,800
Nevertheless, I'm glad you did it!

1049
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:13,940
Yes, in retrospect, me too!

1050
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:16,780
But back in the thesis, I didn't think it
was that special.

1051
00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:20,560
I had gotten used to Zuse, to the machine,
to this whole process.

1052
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:23,420
That was everyday life for both of us,
I speak now also for Uschi!

1053
00:46:24,140 --> 00:46:27,860
I was at Daimler and the diploma thesis was
ticked off and forgotten for me.

1054
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:30,900
It wasn't until years later, when I had
once decided...

1055
00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:33,040
In the department they asked at
Christmas...

1056
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:35,100
Does anyone have an idea what we
could do Christmas?

1057
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:38,160
Then I already had the idea: Yes, you could really
give a Zuse talk!

1058
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:41,520
Sat down at the computer privately,
pulled out old photos...

1059
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:44,540
And I put together a talk like that
from my thesis.

1060
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:46,000
And that's when I realized...

1061
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,320
After I had presented it at the
Christmas party...

1062
00:46:48,860 --> 00:46:51,880
I realized for the first time: Boa, that was
something special!

1063
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,680
I really only realized that then,
years later!

1064
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:57,020
When I was involved...

1065
00:46:57,020 --> 00:46:59,520
Yes, it was important to me, I want to get my....
have my degree!

1066
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:00,920
Have my diploma certificate in
my pocket!

1067
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:02,680
And then I want to go into the industry
and make money!

1068
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:05,000
That was my motivation, logical!

1069
00:47:05,540 --> 00:47:08,500
But this pride and also to
have met Zuse...

1070
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:10,580
To have worked on this piece,
on the machine...

1071
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:13,760
Being a little part of computer
history...

1072
00:47:14,060 --> 00:47:15,620
This is something special in
retrospect!

1073
00:47:15,620 --> 00:47:17,820
But at that time it was not,
I say frankly!

1074
00:47:17,820 --> 00:47:20,440
So it only today that I became
aware of that.

1075
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:24,160
Now that we have discussed the replica in
great detail already,

1076
00:47:24,860 --> 00:47:27,820
I would like to ask a little about the
original Z1.

1077
00:47:29,820 --> 00:47:30,820
Namely...

1078
00:47:30,820 --> 00:47:35,320
You can see it in the film by Mr. Knauer, partly also
through contemporary witnesses,

1079
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:38,560
who show a bit of how it was
done back then:

1080
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:44,320
So really manually with the jigsaw and
with a drill and so on.

1081
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:46,800
And...

1082
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:51,620
Did Konrad Zuse ever talk about what it was
like back then?

1083
00:47:52,540 --> 00:47:56,060
Personally to us, no. I also know it from
the film...

1084
00:47:56,520 --> 00:47:59,820
And I asked him from time to time what it was
like on the old machine.

1085
00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:01,220
And he also answered it briefly.

1086
00:48:01,220 --> 00:48:02,960
But of himself, he didn't say much.

1087
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:05,620
Because at the beginning I also still
believed that the replica...

1088
00:48:06,140 --> 00:48:09,220
This Z1 reconstruction will be an
original replica.

1089
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:12,020
Until he disillusioned me:
No, no, Mr. Saupe!

1090
00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:13,960
This is not about the original appearance of
the machine.

1091
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:17,420
It is about the principle, the calculation principle.
That is the decisive thing!

1092
00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:19,720
Because he had given me constructive
freedom in between.

1093
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:21,500
And then I said: I can't decide
that myself!

1094
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:23,480
This must be according to the
old machine!

1095
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:25,460
And then he disillusioned me:

1096
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:28,740
This is not the... goal from the
Z1 curatorship.

1097
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:32,820
But the proof that my theoretical considerations...
have been correct.

1098
00:48:32,820 --> 00:48:34,560
It was only due to the inaccuracy
of the sheets!

1099
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:37,440
And this is what he once said orally:

1100
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:40,520
That at that time, as you can imagine,
the accuracy was poor!

1101
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:42,920
Because, first of all, he made it
with tinplate...

1102
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:46,200
So he's been flattening tins...
Unbelievable!

1103
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:47,840
Different thicknesses!

1104
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:50,840
You don't always get the same sheet metal in
the same thickness.

1105
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:54,440
When you were flattening, you bring a few
bumps in it.

1106
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:56,180
You bring tension into such a
metal sheet.

1107
00:48:56,680 --> 00:49:00,560
And then, of course, the work with the jigsaw: Even if it is
corrected with a file...

1108
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:03,100
We are talking here about deviations of
several tenths!

1109
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:06,280
So in fact it is unbelievable that it could
have worked at all rudimentary...

1110
00:49:07,220 --> 00:49:07,900
I do not know!

1111
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:11,500
But he was so convinced of his theoretical...

1112
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:16,100
He was so convinced by the considerations and
theoretical explanations that he said:

1113
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:19,000
The replica, we make it and it
will work!

1114
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000
This is so to say...

1115
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,120
But other than that, he didn't say much
about the old machine....

1116
00:49:23,420 --> 00:49:27,220
That it took place in his parents' living room,
which I still find incredible.

1117
00:49:27,220 --> 00:49:29,680
The parents gave away the living room for
two years.

1118
00:49:30,220 --> 00:49:31,300
He was financially...

1119
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:34,460
came into a dead end, because he left
Henschel.

1120
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:38,360
That is, he had no financial supplies to be able to
build the machine.

1121
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:40,940
He could not pay off his students,
fellow students,

1122
00:49:40,940 --> 00:49:43,100
they volunteered to work in their
spare time.

1123
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:45,320
And his sister supported him
financially.

1124
00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:47,180
Lieselotte?
Yes!

1125
00:49:47,180 --> 00:49:49,220
Have you ever met her?
No! No? No!

1126
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:52,600
I have only met Horst and the
youngest daughter.

1127
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:56,840
And Mrs. Zuse, of course, who was *super* nice,
I really have to say this again...

1128
00:49:57,700 --> 00:50:00,680
Mrs. Zuse was always super
friendly to us...

1129
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:02,560
Brought us coffee once
in a while, cake.

1130
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:03,980
I think Konrad Zuse didn't
want that.

1131
00:50:03,980 --> 00:50:05,620
He implied that a couple
of times, to her.

1132
00:50:05,620 --> 00:50:07,880
I once picked up a few
scraps of words.

1133
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:08,760
He didn't want that?

1134
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:11,060
No, he didn't want us to be too
pampered by her.

1135
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:13,760
That is indeed the case!
And...

1136
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:16,000
We had also allowed ourselves, in between,

1137
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,960
Uschi and I, to take our friends
with us.

1138
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:20,780
When we had visitors in Hünfeld,
we asked,

1139
00:50:20,780 --> 00:50:22,540
if we could come in on Saturday to
present the machine.

1140
00:50:22,540 --> 00:50:24,840
Because people wanted to see live
how the machine looked like.

1141
00:50:25,100 --> 00:50:28,520
And there was a phase once in the summer when we
had visitors more often.

1142
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:31,820
Both Uschi, her boyfriend and my
Claudia or also...

1143
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:35,940
Her parents were once with her. My mother was
once a visitor in Hünfeld.

1144
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:37,580
And then the Zuse also
once said:

1145
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:39,540
That would be too much for him now,
he didn't want that anymore.

1146
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:41,800
And there he also clearly showed us the
limits that...

1147
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:45,520
He felt like he was in a museum, probably.

1148
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:47,660
I understand it in retrospect,
he's right too!

1149
00:50:47,660 --> 00:50:49,820
So we may have overdone
it in parts then....

1150
00:50:51,100 --> 00:50:51,640
Yes.

1151
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:54,800
And you have met Horst a few times,
Horst Zuse....

1152
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:57,520
Professor Dr. Horst Zuse, you met
him a few times.

1153
00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:00,200
Did he dig into the machine a
little bit too, right?

1154
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:02,480
No, we only met him in
Berlin...

1155
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:03,340
So only in Berlin.
Yes!

1156
00:51:03,340 --> 00:51:05,920
We knew when we were coming into the museum,
back then, Uschi and I...

1157
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:08,380
For the assembly of the machine and this
film documentation...

1158
00:51:08,860 --> 00:51:10,080
We knew hat he lived there....

1159
00:51:10,340 --> 00:51:14,040
And we asked his mother before for
Horst's address,

1160
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:17,080
And then we contacted him
and met him.

1161
00:51:17,740 --> 00:51:19,700
That was the reason for the contact.
That was also the only contact.

1162
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:21,620
So he was not in Hünfeld
at the time.

1163
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:24,360
Which also makes me wonder why, actually...
I do not know!

1164
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:26,220
Maybe he was busy at work.

1165
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:28,300
Maybe he didn't have such a good
relationship with his father either...

1166
00:51:28,300 --> 00:51:30,900
I absolutely do not know!
But...

1167
00:51:31,460 --> 00:51:33,280
When we met him, that's when it first
became clear to me,

1168
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:35,720
that the also had to do with mathematics
and computers.

1169
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:37,400
And I also noticed:

1170
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:39,360
He looked very much like his father!
And I also...

1171
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:41,160
And also today through film
sequences I realize:

1172
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:42,680
He still looks a lot like his
father today!

1173
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:46,100
So has has been his first child,
the eldest son.

1174
00:51:46,460 --> 00:51:48,460
And the resemblance is
really striking!

1175
00:51:48,460 --> 00:51:51,040
But otherwise, we didn't meet him often,
I think only once.

1176
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:54,480
Whereby, was he also present at
the delivery?

1177
00:51:54,980 --> 00:51:57,680
I have to admit, I was very nervous at the time of
the official ceremony.

1178
00:51:57,680 --> 00:51:59,540
I also just looked in the back at how many
people were sitting there.

1179
00:51:59,540 --> 00:52:02,020
There were a few hundred!
And...

1180
00:52:02,020 --> 00:52:03,760
Lots of celebrities in the
front row.

1181
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:05,020
I haven't looked at every
single person...

1182
00:52:05,020 --> 00:52:07,180
I don't know whether Horst Zuse was
there or not.

1183
00:52:07,420 --> 00:52:09,980
In any case, Mrs. Zuse
was there, too!

1184
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:12,460
Yes...

1185
00:52:12,620 --> 00:52:16,280
And again back to the Original. So as we
already said, is have been relatively...

1186
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:22,800
simple means and even more difficult than
what you have done there.

1187
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:24,400
Unbelievable, Unbelievable!

1188
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:27,880
And yet Konrad Zuse said:

1189
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:30,020
It was the first computer
ever that

1190
00:52:30,020 --> 00:52:33,160
could perform program-controlled
calculations,

1191
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:37,640
albeit with various technical shortcomings
at the time.

1192
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:42,060
But he said:
Calculations could be carried out!

1193
00:52:42,060 --> 00:52:43,340
Well, that's a matter of believing!

1194
00:52:43,340 --> 00:52:46,280
There are even fewer contemporary witnesses
than in our reconstruction!

1195
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:50,480
That's a matter of believing, and it's hard to
believe, in my opinion....

1196
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:53,460
Yes, I agree, based on the experiences

1197
00:52:53,460 --> 00:52:55,900
from the reconstruction, which was super
accurate in the sheet metals.

1198
00:52:56,020 --> 00:52:58,280
And we had constantly hang-ups and
difficulties...

1199
00:52:58,660 --> 00:53:01,400
I can't even imagine what that must have
been like for him.

1200
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:06,300
Perhaps he had pushed by hand when
turning to show they work...

1201
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:09,920
I don't know, it is pure imputation! Logically, we have
not lived in 1936.

1202
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:12,880
And the witnesses that are there,
there are even less.

1203
00:53:13,060 --> 00:53:15,400
In addition, those were the days just
before the war.

1204
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:17,840
A year later, the war has
broken out.

1205
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:20,140
This is all quite difficult to
comprehend!

1206
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:25,820
But his firm belief, 1987 to 89 during the
reconstruction time...

1207
00:53:25,820 --> 00:53:28,580
The conviction of him: We will do that!

1208
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:30,240
The machine will definitely work at
some point!

1209
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:32,780
That showed me that he was sure of
what he was doing.

1210
00:53:32,780 --> 00:53:34,000
How can he be sure?

1211
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:38,860
Because perhaps in 86...1936,37,38 it
worked after all!

1212
00:53:39,140 --> 00:53:41,360
You can believe him that!
Because...

1213
00:53:42,020 --> 00:53:43,780
If the machine had not
been running...

1214
00:53:43,780 --> 00:53:46,180
would he have had the strength to
say 50 years later:

1215
00:53:46,180 --> 00:53:47,980
I'll rebuild this now, that will
work!

1216
00:53:47,980 --> 00:53:50,020
I do not think so! And the courage!
And the courage.

1217
00:53:50,140 --> 00:53:52,900
So he also had something to lose.

1218
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:54,160
If the replica had not worked,

1219
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:56,900
everyone would have said: Oh, look,
that thing was nothing!

1220
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:00,360
That's why you can believe him that the
machine has run.

1221
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:02,120
Maybe he really made it...

1222
00:54:02,260 --> 00:54:03,620
After all, he worked in a completely
different way:

1223
00:54:03,620 --> 00:54:05,420
We have in the machine, you remember in
the museum...

1224
00:54:05,420 --> 00:54:07,340
At this height [15 cm] run all the
metal sheets.

1225
00:54:07,340 --> 00:54:09,080
His machine in the photo:

1226
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:12,040
Has been over a meter high, all these
workflows...

1227
00:54:12,820 --> 00:54:14,980
This means he also had much more
space in between.

1228
00:54:14,980 --> 00:54:17,260
Maybe that was also more clever and he
could access much easier

1229
00:54:17,260 --> 00:54:18,860
these imperfections to the
different layers.

1230
00:54:18,860 --> 00:54:20,380
Maybe he could therefore fix it
faster...

1231
00:54:20,380 --> 00:54:21,880
This is purely a guess on my
part, but....

1232
00:54:23,420 --> 00:54:25,820
You can believe him that. And he was
not the liar!

1233
00:54:25,820 --> 00:54:28,380
He was also able to admit weaknesses.
Zuse also once said:

1234
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:31,360
Yes, back then with my company, I did a lot of
things wrong.

1235
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,200
Today, I would do things differently.

1236
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:36,180
He was the kind of guy who could admit it
when things weren't going well.

1237
00:54:36,580 --> 00:54:38,420
And I wouldn't say he was a liar.

1238
00:54:38,420 --> 00:54:40,820
And when he says the machine
worked back then....

1239
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:43,960
I would be willing to
believe him!

1240
00:54:45,340 --> 00:54:48,760
Yeah, that... would be nice in any case...
Yes!

1241
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:51,280
For Germany, too, I mean.
Yes, also for Germany!

1242
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:53,780
I agree, that would have been another
three years earlier!

1243
00:54:53,780 --> 00:54:55,660
Well, because that's...
I mean...

1244
00:54:55,660 --> 00:54:57,840
We Germans always have a bit of a problem
with national pride....

1245
00:54:57,840 --> 00:55:00,980
But that... would be something...
Yes, absolutely!

1246
00:55:00,980 --> 00:55:04,040
By the way, I am not at all
against pride.

1247
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:08,060
And I am terribly proud of us Germans, especially
when it comes to inventions!

1248
00:55:08,300 --> 00:55:12,220
When I started at KHD, in my first year of apprenticeship,
we went to the original

1249
00:55:12,220 --> 00:55:15,060
building where the original first motor of
Nikolaus Otto was located.

1250
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:16,300
And...

1251
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:21,380
That was been basically the nucleus of
gas engines...

1252
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:23,720
Speak what was later
used in our cars.

1253
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:26,620
Then I joined Daimler, the inventor of
the automobile.

1254
00:55:27,260 --> 00:55:28,460
We can be terribly proud of that!

1255
00:55:28,460 --> 00:55:31,700
We have really had in our society,
in our science,

1256
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:33,860
fine heads who were there very,
very early.

1257
00:55:33,860 --> 00:55:35,740
And our prosperity that we
have today,

1258
00:55:35,740 --> 00:55:38,060
is also largely based on
these inventions!

1259
00:55:38,820 --> 00:55:41,560
Where, of course, we are not proud of what
happened during the Nazi era....

1260
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:43,940
I don't want to deny that at all...
Terrible!

1261
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:45,320
And I also think it's good that right now

1262
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:47,600
document everything that we do
not forget it.

1263
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:51,080
But we should also not forget...
Also a Felix Wankel...

1264
00:55:51,860 --> 00:55:53,100
All inventions!

1265
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:57,520
We Germans have done an incredible amount!
And I'm proud of that, too, I say...

1266
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:01,700
You can also have a good pride without being
pushed into the right corner.

1267
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:04,560
But I am proud of these heads and of
our inventors!

1268
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:06,980
Good topic for the end...

1269
00:56:06,980 --> 00:56:08,520
I don't know who wrote it....

1270
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:09,900
You maybe can say something more about it,
but....

1271
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:12,640
Yes?

1272
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:17,500
I'll have to read the sentence
myself or read it aloud....

1273
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:19,360
Yes or you read it out?
Yes!

1274
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:20,700
Well at...

1275
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:25,620
At the end of the thesis is something
interesting, also regarding...

1276
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:28,740
Yes, philosophical question
almost...

1277
00:56:32,060 --> 00:56:39,040
How technology can influence us.
Yes, until today, is definitely like that!

1278
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:44,000
You'll find the end for sure!
Give me a second!

1279
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:48,540
That starts with:
The past and present show us...

1280
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:53,020
(Dietmar turns pages)

1281
00:56:53,020 --> 00:56:54,580
Ha, ah, the drawings....

1282
00:56:54,580 --> 00:56:56,800
Attachment, okay... I have to come before
the attachment.

1283
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:58,100
Haven't read it in a while, hmm?

1284
00:56:58,100 --> 00:57:03,420
Nah, that's so, yes, that's so,
not no, but yes!

1285
00:57:03,540 --> 00:57:05,180
Closing words!
Closing words!

1286
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:08,000
50 years ago Konrad Zuse started the
development and so on...

1287
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:08,980
Is that it?

1288
00:57:08,980 --> 00:57:11,420
No, the past is at the
very end, I think.

1289
00:57:11,420 --> 00:57:13,060
So that's already closing words,
so there....

1290
00:57:13,060 --> 00:57:14,780
Search for past and present!

1291
00:57:14,780 --> 00:57:17,380
The past and the present show us,

1292
00:57:17,380 --> 00:57:20,900
that technical progress is unfortunately not
infrequently misused

1293
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:23,560
and causes harm to people instead of
benefiting them.

1294
00:57:24,140 --> 00:57:25,480
I guess that's true...

1295
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:28,340
Therefore, the development of the computer
brings a great responsibility

1296
00:57:28,340 --> 00:57:31,700
with it, especially with regard to future generations.

1297
00:57:31,700 --> 00:57:33,960
It is to be hoped that the computer will be
used in this way,

1298
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:35,900
as it was intended by the inventor.

1299
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:38,120
Because Zuse's goal was,

1300
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:43,060
Those unspeakable calculations as an
engineer that he found annoying....

1301
00:57:43,060 --> 00:57:44,540
After all, he wanted to
present a result.

1302
00:57:44,540 --> 00:57:47,600
The calculation was only a means to an end.
That he wanted to automate!

1303
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:51,440
That is, this computer should help him
take the actual step.

1304
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:55,500
He had things in his head, visions, like
self-replicating machines....

1305
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:58,820
After all, what Kuka is doing with robots today
has become reality.

1306
00:57:58,820 --> 00:58:02,800
He already wanted to do that in 1936! And that
was his motivation.

1307
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:05,240
That the computer is abused in
many ways...

1308
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:07,160
And that is what we are experiencing today in
the age of the Internet.

1309
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:11,320
And writing any bots,
hacker programs...

1310
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:12,680
Exactly the opposite is
being done!

1311
00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:14,840
After all, it is only abused to do
some nonsense.

1312
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:16,700
Das war nicht in seinem Sinne!

1313
00:58:16,700 --> 00:58:19,600
And he realized that early on,
that this could happen:

1314
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:22,400
That in this huge opportunity of the computer
also lies the danger.

1315
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:25,060
And that's what he wanted to say. I think
that was his sentence.

1316
00:58:25,060 --> 00:58:28,020
I can't remember which one of us
formulated that sentence...

1317
00:58:28,460 --> 00:58:29,740
Whether it was a final sentence
from him,

1318
00:58:29,740 --> 00:58:31,600
whether that was Uschi, or me,
I don't know anymore!

1319
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:33,740
That would be a lie now, but it's a
beautiful phrase.

1320
00:58:33,740 --> 00:58:35,680
I haven't read that for a
long time either...

1321
00:58:36,260 --> 00:58:40,360
And today actually shows how...
How topical it is!

1322
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:43,800
More topical than ever! The was not so
topical in 1988!

1323
00:58:44,060 --> 00:58:45,900
The real abuses came only
afterwards!

1324
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:48,620
Terrible, isn't it?
Yes...

1325
00:58:48,620 --> 00:58:49,940
And I was a part of it!

1326
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:50,940
Yes...
Ei, ei, ei...

1327
00:58:50,940 --> 00:58:52,280
Yes...

1328
00:58:53,380 --> 00:58:56,520
Yes then Dietmar, super cool that you
took the time!

1329
00:58:56,520 --> 00:58:58,620
Was really great!

1330
00:58:58,620 --> 00:59:00,460
It was also for me a time travel
back in time.

1331
00:59:00,460 --> 00:59:04,680
I also notice emotionally myself what we
did back then and...

1332
00:59:05,020 --> 00:59:06,500
Was nice talking to you
about it!

1333
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:08,020
And that someone was interested in it!

1334
00:59:08,020 --> 00:59:10,660
Because for many years no one was
interested in our diploma thesis.

1335
00:59:11,060 --> 00:59:12,680
In this respect,
I also thank you!

1336
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:13,180
Yes.

1337
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:19,860
(Applause)
