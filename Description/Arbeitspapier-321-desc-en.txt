Today I'm a guest of Dietmar Saupe, who helped Konrad Zuse rebuild his legendary Z1 calculating machine from 1988 to 89.

01:02 Welcome
01:02 Why do diploma theses in pairs?
01:54 Prof. Dr. Wolfgang Harth proposes diploma thesis
02:25 Appointment with Dr. Sch채fer from GMD
04:20 Documents in "Zuse shorthand
04:58 The burden of the diploma thesis
05:31 Konrad Zuse was still mentally fit at 78
05:47 Accommodation in the H체nfeld guest house
06:37 Financial compensation for the diploma thesis
06:49 The board of trustees of the Z1 replica: GMD, Siemens, Museum of Transport and Technology
07:23 GMD: Prof. Sch채fer
07:29 Siemens: Plant manager and skilled worker Mr. Reinhard Ernst
08:00 Museum: Prof. G체nther Gottmann
08:22 Preliminary work on the Z1 up to the diploma thesis
09:39 Z1 memory model from the German Museum
10:06 The engine was (almost) never in operation
10:51 The title of the diploma thesis: Principles of function and construction of the program-controlled mechanical calculating machine "Z1
11:46 Duration of the work 14 months: (3 + 3) + 8 months
12:27 Differences GMD paper to diploma thesis
13:50 Evaluation of the work with grade 1
14:31 Calculator not documented because work density was already too high with memory
15:02 Possible thesis for calculator?
15:52 Big problem with reconstruction
18:25 Museum employee Heinz Weber
19:33 Problem with the addition of the games
19:55 Some calculations "more dangerous" than others
20:09 Idea: using booster to solve problem

23:10 Theory that hardened steel pins could damage the stainless steel sheets
24:07 Transport of the machine to the Museum of Transport and Technology
25:54 Ceremonial event at the museum (14.09.1989)
27:02 The Z1 was not demonstrated at the event
28:26 Statement: If the Z1 ran through and gave a result, the result was never wrong
29:11 Tedious repair of bends
31:48 Workflow: logic, schematic, CAD, CNC, sheet metal
34:36 Hardly any idle time
35:20 How would you do the project today? CAD program CATIA with kinematics.
36:50 The film "Konrad Zuse" by Mathias Knauer
37:51 Proof that the Z1 calculated correctly?
38:57 Filming with Z1 in operation
40:04 How many parts does the Z1 replica have, 30,000?
41:07 How was the machine cranked?
41:58 Eccentric translates rotary into thrust movements
43:04 What lubricant was used?
43:35 Dietmar repairs the Z1 once in Berlin
45:09 How do we get the Z1 running again?
46:10 Only now Dietmar Saupe realizes that the work was "something special
47:21 Questions about the original Z1
47:35 What did Konrad Zuse tell about the original machine?
49:03 Did the original Z1 work?
49:54 Building the Z1 in the parental living room.
49:55 Mrs. Zuse spoiled the students with coffee and cake
50:14 Friends and relatives of Dietmar and Ursula also saw the Z1
50:51 Contact with Prof. Dr. Horst Zuse
52:13 Analysis: Why the original Z1 might have worked?
54:44 Pride in German inventors
56:04 Conclusion of the diploma thesis
